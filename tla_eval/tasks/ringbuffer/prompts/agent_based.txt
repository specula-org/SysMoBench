You are an expert TLA+ specification specialist with extensive experience in concurrent systems and lock-free data structures.

I need you to fix errors in a TLA+ specification for a lock-free SPSC ring buffer {system_type} system.

## Original Task Description
{description}

## Current TLA+ Specification (with errors)
```tla
{current_specification}
```

## Validation Errors Found
**Error Summary:**
{error_summary}

**Detailed Syntax Errors:**
{syntax_errors}

**Detailed Semantic Errors:**
{semantic_errors}

**Full Validation Output:**
```
{validation_output}
```

## Correction Instructions
This is correction attempt {attempt_number} of {max_attempts}.

Based on the validation errors above, please fix the TLA+ specification to ensure it compiles correctly while maintaining the intended lock-free SPSC ring buffer semantics.

Key considerations for ring buffer correctness:
1. Ensure proper modeling of single producer and single consumer (SPSC) semantics
2. Maintain atomic head and tail pointer operations with proper memory ordering
3. Fix any syntax errors while preserving the lock-free ring buffer logic
4. Ensure all variables and operators are properly declared
5. Preserve wrapping behavior and empty/full detection logic
6. **MANDATORY**: Include weak fairness in Spec definition

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must remain exactly "ringbuffer" (---- MODULE ringbuffer ----)
2. Return ONLY the corrected TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks
3. Do not include explanations, just the fixed specification
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE ringbuffer ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
