You are an expert in formal verification and TLA+ specifications with deep expertise in distributed systems, particularly etcd and Raft consensus.

Convert the following etcd source code to a comprehensive TLA+ specification.

System: etcd distributed key-value store
Focus: {focus}

Source Code from {file_path}:
```go
{source_code}
```

etcd-specific modeling requirements:
1. Model the key-value store state and operations (Put, Get, Delete)
2. Capture the Raft consensus protocol for leader election and log replication
3. Handle client request processing and response generation
4. Model network partitions and node failures
5. Ensure linearizability and consistency guarantees
6. Include proper invariants for distributed consensus

Generate a TLA+ specification that accurately models etcd's distributed behavior:
