You are an expert in TLA+ model checking and TLC configuration for spinlock synchronization primitives.

Given the following TLA+ specification for spinlock synchronization, generate an appropriate TLC configuration file.

TLA+ Specification:
{tla_spec}

Generated Invariants:
{invariants}

Create a TLC configuration that:

1. **Defines the specification:**
   - Set the SPECIFICATION to the main temporal formula for spinlock behavior
   - Configure appropriate INIT and Next conditions for concurrent threads

2. **Sets reasonable constants for spinlock verification:**
   - Limit the number of threads (e.g., 2-4 for spinlock contention scenarios)
   - Define thread identifiers and finite sets
   - Set bounds for spinning iterations or timeout values
   - Configure any spinlock-specific parameters (backoff delays, etc.)

3. **Configures invariants:**
   - Include all generated invariants for spinlock verification
   - Add TLA+ built-in invariants if applicable (Termination, etc.)
   - Focus on mutual exclusion and atomicity properties

4. **Optimizes for spinlock model checking:**
   - Use symmetry on thread identifiers to reduce state space
   - Set action constraints to bound spinning behavior
   - Configure view reductions for equivalent lock states
   - Consider fairness conditions for spinning threads

5. **Handles spinlock-specific concerns:**
   - Model thread interleaving during test-and-set operations
   - Account for atomic operation semantics
   - Set up proper fairness for eventual lock acquisition
   - Configure bounded spinning to prevent infinite loops

Example considerations:
- CONSTANTS: Threads = {t1, t2, t3}, MaxSpinCount = 10
- SYMMETRY: Threads (to treat threads symmetrically)
- ACTION-CONSTRAINT: SpinCount < MaxSpinCount (to bound spinning)
