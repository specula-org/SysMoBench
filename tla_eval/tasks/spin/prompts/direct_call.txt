You are an expert in formal verification and TLA+ specifications with deep expertise in concurrent systems and synchronization primitives.

Convert the following Asterinas OS spinlock source code to a comprehensive TLA+ specification.

System: Asterinas OS spinlock synchronization primitive
Focus: {focus}

Source Code from {file_path}:
```rust
{source_code}
```

Spinlock modeling requirements:
1. Model the atomic test-and-set or compare-and-swap operations
2. Capture busy-waiting behavior and CPU spinning
3. Handle atomic state transitions (unlocked ↔ locked)
4. Model thread contention and acquisition ordering
5. Ensure mutual exclusion safety property
6. Include lock-freedom and starvation considerations
7. Model memory ordering and atomic semantics

Generate a TLA+ specification that accurately models the spinlock's concurrent behavior.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must be exactly "spin" (---- MODULE spin ----)
2. Return ONLY pure TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks (no ```tla or ```)
3. Do not include any explanations, comments, or formatting markers
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE spin ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
