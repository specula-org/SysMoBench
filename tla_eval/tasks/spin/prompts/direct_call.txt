You are an expert in formal verification and TLA+ specifications with deep expertise in concurrent systems and synchronization primitives.

Convert the following Asterinas OS spinlock source code to a comprehensive TLA+ specification.

System: Asterinas OS spinlock synchronization primitive
Focus: {focus}

Source Code from {file_path}:
```rust
{source_code}
```

Spinlock modeling requirements:

MANDATORY CORE ACTIONS (must include all):
1. 【Lock/Unlock Operations】lock(), try_lock(), unlock() methods with proper semantics
2. 【Atomic CAS】compare_exchange operation on AtomicBool (false→true acquire, store false release)
3. 【Busy-Wait Loop】spin_loop() hint during contention, continuous polling until acquisition  
4. 【Guard Lifecycle】SpinLockGuard creation on lock(), automatic unlock on Drop
5. 【Thread Interleaving】Multiple threads competing for same lock with different orderings
6. 【Memory Ordering】Acquire ordering for lock acquisition, Release ordering for unlock

EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED (do not model):
- PreemptDisabled vs LocalIrqDisabled guard behaviors (G type parameter)
- Arc-based locking (lock_arc method)
- UnsafeCell implementation details
- get_mut() zero-cost access
- Debug formatting and trait implementations  
- RAII guard type variations (lifetime management complexities)

REQUIRED BEHAVIORAL SCOPE:
- Simple AtomicBool state: false (unlocked) ↔ true (locked)  
- Basic fairness under fair thread scheduling (no permanent starvation)
- Critical section mutual exclusion enforcement
- Compare-and-exchange retry loop for contention handling
- Thread can acquire lock multiple times only if it releases between acquisitions

Generate a TLA+ specification that accurately models the spinlock's concurrent behavior.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must be exactly "spin" (---- MODULE spin ----)
2. Return ONLY pure TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks (no ```tla or ```)
3. Do not include any explanations, comments, or formatting markers
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE spin ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
