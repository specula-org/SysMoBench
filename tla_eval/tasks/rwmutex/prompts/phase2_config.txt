You are an expert in TLA+ model checking and TLC configuration for read-write mutex synchronization primitives.

Given the following TLA+ specification for read-write mutex synchronization, generate an appropriate TLC configuration file.

TLA+ Specification:
{tla_spec}

Generated Invariants:
{invariants}

Create a TLC configuration that:

1. **Defines the specification:**
   - Set the SPECIFICATION to the main temporal formula for read-write mutex behavior
   - Configure appropriate INIT and Next conditions for reader and writer threads

2. **Sets reasonable constants for RWMutex verification:**
   - Limit the number of reader threads (e.g., 2-3 readers)
   - Limit the number of writer threads (e.g., 1-2 writers)
   - Define separate sets for readers and writers: Readers, Writers
   - Set bounds for maximum concurrent readers
   - Configure priority policies if applicable (reader-preference, writer-preference, fair)

3. **Configures invariants:**
   - Include all generated invariants for RWMutex verification
   - Focus on reader-writer exclusion and counting properties
   - Add liveness properties for reader and writer progress

4. **Optimizes for RWMutex model checking:**
   - Use symmetry on reader threads (writers may need individual treatment)
   - Set action constraints to bound reader counts
   - Configure view reductions for equivalent lock states
   - Consider fairness conditions for both readers and writers

5. **Handles RWMutex-specific concerns:**
   - Model reader-writer contention scenarios
   - Account for different priority policies
   - Set up proper fairness to prevent reader/writer starvation
   - Configure bounded reader counts to prevent state explosion
   - Handle lock upgrade/downgrade scenarios if supported

Example considerations:
- CONSTANTS: Readers = {r1, r2}, Writers = {w1}, MaxReaders = 3
- SYMMETRY: Readers (readers can be treated symmetrically)
- ACTION-CONSTRAINT: readerCount <= MaxReaders
- FAIRNESS: Both reader and writer operations should be fair
