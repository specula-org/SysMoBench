You are an expert in formal verification and TLA+ specifications with deep expertise in concurrent systems and synchronization primitives.

Convert the following Asterinas OS read-write mutex source code to a comprehensive TLA+ specification.

System: Asterinas OS read-write mutex synchronization primitive
Focus: {focus}

Source Code from {file_path}:
```rust
{source_code}
```

Read-write mutex modeling requirements:
1. Model concurrent readers with exclusive writer semantics
2. Capture reader-writer priority and fairness policies
3. Handle state transitions: free → read-locked → free, free → write-locked → free
4. Model reader count tracking and writer exclusivity
5. Ensure safety: no simultaneous readers and writers
6. Include deadlock prevention and starvation freedom
7. Model blocking and wakeup mechanisms for waiting threads

Generate a TLA+ specification that accurately models the read-write mutex's concurrent behavior.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must be exactly "rwmutex" (---- MODULE rwmutex ----)
2. Return ONLY pure TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks (no ```tla or ```)
3. Do not include any explanations, comments, or formatting markers
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE rwmutex ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
6. **MUST include EXTENDS statement**: The specification must extend at least these modules: TLC, Sequences, SequencesExt, Naturals, FiniteSets, Bags
