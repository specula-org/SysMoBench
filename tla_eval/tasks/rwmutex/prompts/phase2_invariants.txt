You are an expert in TLA+ specifications and formal verification of concurrent systems, particularly read-write mutex synchronization primitives.

Given the following TLA+ specification for read-write mutex synchronization, generate appropriate invariants for model checking.

TLA+ Specification:
{tla_spec}

Generate invariants that verify the correctness of the read-write mutex primitive, focusing on:

1. **Safety Properties:**
   - Reader-writer exclusion: No simultaneous readers and writers
   - Writer exclusion: At most one writer at any time
   - Reader counting: Reader count is always non-negative and accurate
   - State consistency: RWMutex state is always valid

2. **Liveness Properties:**
   - Reader progress: Readers eventually gain access when no writers
   - Writer progress: Writers eventually gain exclusive access
   - Starvation freedom: Neither readers nor writers are permanently blocked
   - Fairness: Consider reader-writer fairness policies

3. **RWMutex-Specific Properties:**
   - Multiple reader semantics: Multiple threads can read simultaneously
   - Exclusive writer semantics: Writers have exclusive access
   - Priority policies: Respect reader/writer priority if specified
   - Upgrade/downgrade correctness: If supported, lock upgrades are safe

4. **State Invariants:**
   - Valid states: rwState \in {"FREE", "READ_LOCKED", "WRITE_LOCKED"}
   - Reader count consistency: readerCount >= 0
   - Writer uniqueness: If write-locked, exactly one writer
   - Reader-writer mutual exclusion: ~(HasReaders /\ HasWriter)

Output format requirements:
1. Return a list of invariant expressions, one per line
2. Each invariant should be a valid TLA+ boolean expression
3. Use meaningful names that describe what the invariant checks
4. Format: InvariantName == boolean_expression
5. Do not include explanatory text, only the invariant definitions

Example format:
ReaderWriterMutualExclusion == ~(readerCount > 0 /\ writerPresent = TRUE)
ValidRWState == rwState \in {"FREE", "READ_LOCKED", "WRITE_LOCKED"}
ReaderCountConsistency == readerCount >= 0
WriterExclusivity == writerPresent = TRUE => readerCount = 0
