You are an expert in distributed systems testing and the CURP consensus protocol with experience in trace-based verification.

## Task
Generate a trace configuration for testing the CURP consensus protocol implementation against its TLA+ specification.

## CURP Protocol Context
CURP (Consensus with Unreplicated Proposed commands) features:
- **Speculative Execution**: Commands execute before full consensus
- **Enhanced Availability**: Super quorum mechanisms
- **Multiple Quorum Types**: quorum, recover_quorum, super_quorum
- **Reduced Latency**: Through speculative command processing
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Command proposals and responses

The implementation abstracts complex Raft details while focusing on core CURP consensus logic.

## Current Specification
```tla
{current_specification}
```

## Trace Configuration Requirements

Generate a configuration that:

1. **Defines test scenarios** for CURP protocol verification:
   - Normal operation with speculative execution
   - Node failures and recovery scenarios
   - Leader change scenarios (abstracted)
   - Various quorum situations
   - Client request patterns

2. **Specifies trace parameters**:
   - Number of nodes in the cluster
   - Command types and sequences
   - Failure patterns to test
   - Recovery scenarios
   - Network partition scenarios (if applicable)

3. **Sets verification targets**:
   - Properties to verify against the specification
   - Invariants to check during trace execution
   - Liveness properties to validate
   - CURP-specific consistency checks

4. **Configures trace generation**:
   - Trace length and complexity
   - Event ordering and timing
   - State space exploration strategy
   - Coverage targets for CURP features

5. **Optimizes for meaningful testing**:
   - Representative scenarios for CURP protocol
   - Edge cases in quorum calculations
   - Speculative execution edge cases
   - Recovery and availability scenarios

**Output format**: YAML configuration file suitable for trace generation tools.

**Return only the YAML configuration** - no explanations or markdown formatting.
