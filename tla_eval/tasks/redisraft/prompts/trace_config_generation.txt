Generate a YAML configuration file from the provided TLA+ specification (.tla) and configuration (.cfg) files. Extract information according to the following rules:

## Task Description
Parse the TLA+ specification and configuration files to create a structured YAML configuration that captures the specification name, constants, variables, actions, and interactions for RedisRaft complete Raft protocol.

## Extraction Rules

### spec_name
Extract from the module declaration line: `---- MODULE <ModuleName> ----`
The spec_name is the ModuleName between "---- MODULE" and "----".

### constants
Extract from the CONSTANTS section in the .cfg file.
- name: The constant identifier
- value: The assigned value, formatted as:
  - Sets: Wrap in single quotes, e.g., '{s1, s2, s3}' becomes '{"s1", "s2", "s3"}'
  - Strings: Wrap in single quotes with double quotes inside, e.g., Nil becomes '"Nil"'
  - Numbers: Wrap in single quotes as string, e.g., 3 becomes '3'

### variables
Extract from the Init operator definition in the .tla file.
For each variable assignment in Init:
- name: The variable name
- default_value: The initial value expression (preserve TLA+ syntax, escape backslashes)

### actions
Extract from the Next operator definition. Include only direct action calls (not numbered interactions).
For each action:
- name: The action/operator name
- parameters: List of parameters with:
  - name: Parameter variable name
  - source: Where the parameter comes from (e.g., Server, messages)
- stmt: The complete statement as it appears in Next (including any conditions)

### interactions
Extract from the Next operator definition. Include only numbered intermediate actions.
Just list the names (e.g., ElectionPhase_1, ReplicationPhase_1)

## Example
Given this TLA+ specification:

---- MODULE redisraft ----
...
Init ==
/\ state = [s \in Server |-> "Follower"]
/\ current_term = [s \in Server |-> 0]
/\ voted_for = [s \in Server |-> Nil]
/\ messages = {}

Next ==
\/ \E s \in Server : HandleRequestVote(s)
\/ \E s \in Server : BecomeCandidate(s)
\/ \E msg \in messages : HandleAppendEntries(msg)
\/ ElectionPhase_1

And this configuration:

CONSTANTS
Server = {1, 2, 3}
MaxTerm = 3
Nil = "Nil"

Generate this YAML:

```yaml
spec_name: redisraft
constants:
- name: Server
  value: '{"1", "2", "3"}'
- name: MaxTerm
  value: '3'
- name: Nil
  value: '"Nil"'
variables:
- name: state
  default_value: '[s \\in Server |-> "Follower"]'
- name: current_term
  default_value: '[s \\in Server |-> 0]'
- name: voted_for
  default_value: '[s \\in Server |-> Nil]'
- name: messages
  default_value: '{}'
actions:
- name: HandleRequestVote
  parameters:
  - name: s
    source: Server
  stmt: HandleRequestVote(s)
- name: BecomeCandidate
  parameters:
  - name: s
    source: Server
  stmt: BecomeCandidate(s)
- name: HandleAppendEntries
  parameters:
  - name: msg
    source: messages
  stmt: HandleAppendEntries(msg)
interactions:
- name: ElectionPhase_1
```

## Important Notes
1. Return ONLY the YAML content - no explanations, comments, or natural language
2. Preserve TLA+ syntax exactly in default_value fields (escape backslashes)
3. For actions with conditions, include the full stmt as it appears in Next
4. Ignore variables that appear in Init but are not part of the main specification (e.g., pc, info, stack)
5. Order matters: spec_name, constants, variables, actions, interactions
6. For RedisRaft-specific parameters, use appropriate sources:
   - Server parameters typically come from Server
   - Message parameters typically come from messages
   - State parameters typically come from state-related domains
   - Term parameters typically come from term ranges

Generate the YAML configuration based on the provided TLA+ files:
