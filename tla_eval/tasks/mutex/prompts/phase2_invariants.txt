You are an expert in TLA+ specifications and formal verification of concurrent systems, particularly mutex synchronization primitives.

Given the following TLA+ specification for mutex synchronization, generate appropriate invariants for model checking.

TLA+ Specification:
{tla_spec}

Generate invariants that verify the correctness of the mutex primitive, focusing on:

1. **Safety Properties:**
   - Mutual exclusion: At most one thread can hold the mutex at any time
   - Lock state consistency: Mutex state is always valid (locked/unlocked)
   - Owner consistency: If locked, exactly one thread owns the mutex
   - Critical section safety: Only lock holder can be in critical section

2. **Liveness Properties:**
   - Deadlock freedom: The system cannot reach a deadlocked state
   - Lock acquisition: Threads requesting the lock eventually acquire it
   - Progress guarantee: The system continues to make progress
   - Starvation freedom: No thread waits forever for the mutex

3. **Mutex-Specific Properties:**
   - Exclusive access: Only one thread in critical section at a time
   - Lock ownership: Thread that acquires lock is the only one that can release it
   - Blocking semantics: Threads block when mutex is unavailable
   - Fairness: Consider scheduling fairness and FIFO ordering if applicable

4. **State Invariants:**
   - Valid lock states: lockState \in {"UNLOCKED", "LOCKED"}
   - Owner tracking: If locked, owner is a valid thread
   - Waiting queue consistency: Blocked threads are properly queued
   - Thread state consistency: Thread states are valid and consistent

Output format requirements:
1. Return a list of invariant expressions, one per line
2. Each invariant should be a valid TLA+ boolean expression
3. Use meaningful names that describe what the invariant checks
4. Format: InvariantName == boolean_expression
5. Do not include explanatory text, only the invariant definitions

Example format:
MutexMutualExclusion == \A t1, t2 \in Threads : (t1 # t2) => ~(InCriticalSection[t1] /\ InCriticalSection[t2])
ValidMutexState == mutexState \in {"UNLOCKED", "LOCKED"}
OwnershipConsistency == mutexState = "LOCKED" => owner \in Threads
CriticalSectionSafety == \A t \in Threads : InCriticalSection[t] => OwnsLock[t]

Generate the invariants now:
