You are an expert in formal verification and TLA+ specifications with deep expertise in concurrent systems and synchronization primitives.

Convert the following Asterinas OS mutex source code to a comprehensive TLA+ specification.

System: Asterinas OS mutex synchronization primitive  
Focus: {focus}

Source Code from {file_path}:
```rust
{source_code}
```

Mutex modeling requirements:

MANDATORY CORE ACTIONS (must include all):
1. 【Lock/Unlock Operations】lock(), try_lock(), unlock() methods with proper blocking/non-blocking semantics
2. 【Atomic CAS】compare_exchange operation on AtomicBool (false→true acquire, store false release)
3. 【WaitQueue Blocking】wait_until() blocking mechanism, wake_one() notification on unlock
4. 【Guard Lifecycle】MutexGuard creation on lock(), automatic unlock on Drop
5. 【Thread Interleaving】Multiple threads competing for exclusive access with different orderings
6. 【Memory Ordering】Acquire ordering for lock acquisition, Release ordering for unlock

EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED (do not model):
- Arc-based locking (lock_arc method and ArcMutexGuard)
- UnsafeCell implementation details
- get_mut() zero-cost access
- Debug formatting and trait implementations
- Thread ownership tracking complexities beyond basic exclusion
- Advanced guard type variations (lifetime management complexities)

REQUIRED BEHAVIORAL SCOPE:
- Simple AtomicBool state: false (unlocked) ↔ true (locked)
- Exclusive access enforcement (only one thread in critical section)
- Basic fairness under fair thread scheduling (no permanent starvation)
- WaitQueue-based blocking and wakeup coordination
- Thread can reacquire lock only after releasing it
- Non-blocking try_lock() vs blocking lock() semantics differentiation

Generate a TLA+ specification that accurately models the mutex's concurrent behavior.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must be exactly "mutex" (---- MODULE mutex ----)
2. Return ONLY pure TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks (no ```tla or ```)
3. Do not include any explanations, comments, or formatting markers
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE mutex ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
6. **DO NOT define invariants** (like MutualExclusion, Invariant, etc.) - only include TypeOK, Init, actions, Next, Spec, and Vars
7. **MUST include EXTENDS statement**: The specification must extend at least these modules: TLC, Sequences, SequencesExt, Naturals, FiniteSets, Bags
8. **MANDATORY Spec Definition with Weak Fairness**: The Spec definition MUST include weak fairness for progress guarantees. Use the pattern:
   Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_Vars /\ WF_Vars(Next)
   (Replace "Vars" and "Next" with your actual variable tuple and next-state action names)
