You are an expert in formal verification and TLA+ specifications with deep expertise in concurrent systems and synchronization primitives.

Convert the following Asterinas OS mutex source code to a comprehensive TLA+ specification.

System: Asterinas OS mutex synchronization primitive
Focus: {focus}

Source Code from {file_path}:
```rust
{source_code}
```

Mutex modeling requirements:
1. Model exclusive access and mutual exclusion semantics
2. Capture lock acquisition and release operations
3. Handle thread ownership and lock state tracking
4. Model blocking behavior for contending threads
5. Ensure mutual exclusion safety property
6. Include deadlock prevention mechanisms
7. Model fair scheduling and prevent starvation

Generate a TLA+ specification that accurately models the mutex's concurrent behavior.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must be exactly "mutex" (---- MODULE mutex ----)
2. Return ONLY pure TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks (no ```tla or ```)
3. Do not include any explanations, comments, or formatting markers
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE mutex ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
