You are an expert in TLA+ model checking and TLC configuration for mutex synchronization primitives.

Given the following TLA+ specification for mutex synchronization, generate an appropriate TLC configuration file.

TLA+ Specification:
{tla_spec}

Generated Invariants:
{invariants}

Create a TLC configuration that:

1. **Defines the specification:**
   - Set the SPECIFICATION to the main temporal formula for mutex behavior
   - Configure appropriate INIT and Next conditions for competing threads

2. **Sets reasonable constants for mutex verification:**
   - Limit the number of threads (e.g., 3-4 threads for contention scenarios)
   - Define thread identifiers and finite sets
   - Set bounds for critical section execution time
   - Configure waiting queue size limits if applicable
   - Define fairness policies (FIFO, priority-based, etc.)

3. **Configures invariants:**
   - Include all generated invariants for mutex verification
   - Focus on mutual exclusion and deadlock freedom properties
   - Add liveness properties for lock acquisition and progress

4. **Optimizes for mutex model checking:**
   - Use symmetry on thread identifiers to reduce state space
   - Set action constraints to bound waiting times
   - Configure view reductions for equivalent mutex states
   - Consider fairness conditions for lock acquisition

5. **Handles mutex-specific concerns:**
   - Model thread contention and blocking scenarios
   - Account for different scheduling policies
   - Set up proper fairness to prevent thread starvation
   - Configure bounded critical section time to ensure progress
   - Handle priority inversion scenarios if applicable

Example considerations:
- CONSTANTS: Threads = {t1, t2, t3}, MaxCriticalSectionTime = 5
- SYMMETRY: Threads (all threads can be treated symmetrically)
- ACTION-CONSTRAINT: criticalSectionTime <= MaxCriticalSectionTime
- FAIRNESS: WF_vars(AcquireLock) for each thread

Output the complete TLC configuration file content:
