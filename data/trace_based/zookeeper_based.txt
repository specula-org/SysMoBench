The first number in each file name is the trace run number and the second number is the index of the node.

A trace file encodes a single TLA+ module–like artifact whose body is an ordered list of numbered global states.
- Each state is a conjunction of variable assignments to TLA+ expressions.
- Expressions use standard TLA+ syntax.
- Formatting details such as indentation and blank lines serve readability; the syntactic tokens (`STATE_n ==`, `/\`, `=`, `{}`, `[]`, `()`, `<<>>`, `:>`, `@@`, commas, and `|->`) carry the actual structure.

Each state block has the form:

```text
STATE_<n> == 
/\ <var-or-expression-1>
/\ <var-or-expression-2>
...
/\ <var-or-expression-k>
```
Details:
* The state header appears at the start of a line.
* Each subsequent non-blank line in the state starts with a conjonction `/\ ` 
* After `/\ `, the line begins either:
  * An assignment of a named variable, or
  * A continuation of a multi-line value (when the previous line’s value continues).
* Typical assignment form (single-line start):

  ```text
  /\ <Identifier> = <TLA+ expression>
  ```
